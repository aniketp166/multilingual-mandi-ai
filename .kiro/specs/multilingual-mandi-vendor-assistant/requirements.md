# Requirements Document: Multilingual Mandi - Vendor Assistant (Frontend-Only)

## Introduction

The Multilingual Mandi - Vendor Assistant is a frontend-only web application that enables vendors to communicate across language barriers, receive AI-powered market price suggestions, and negotiate more effectively with buyers. The system uses LocalStorage for data persistence and direct Gemini AI integration for intelligent features, eliminating the need for backend infrastructure while maintaining full functionality.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Data Storage**: Browser LocalStorage (client-side persistence)
- **AI Services**: Direct integration with Google Gemini API
- **Deployment**: Vercel static/serverless hosting

## Glossary

- **Vendor**: A seller who posts items for sale, sets prices, and negotiates with buyers
- **Buyer**: A customer who views items and communicates with vendors to purchase products
- **Gemini_AI_Service**: Direct integration with Google Gemini API for translation, pricing, and negotiation assistance
- **LocalStorage_Manager**: Client-side data persistence layer managing products, preferences, and chat history
- **Product_Listing**: An item posted by a vendor with name, quantity, price, and language stored in LocalStorage
- **Chat_Session**: Communication channel between vendor and buyer stored locally with AI assistance
- **Market_Price**: AI-suggested price range generated by Gemini API based on product analysis
